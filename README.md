  <h2 id="describe">Description</h2>

  This command line application allows the managers to keep track and update employee information quickly right from the command line.
  My goal in creating this aplication was To make keeping track of employee roles and salaries easy.

  Through makign this application, I learned how to use MySQL, Console.table and how to connect a database I created to an inquirer prompt.

  In the future, I am planning to add more functionality to the application so that employees, roles and departments can be deleted.

Once that is done open your command line and navigate to the db/ file. in the db/ file open your mysql and source in the schema.sql and seeds.sql. Once that is finished, navigate back to the root directory and outside of mysql run node index and follow the prompts.

  Follow along with the prompts given in the command line after you have run node index.js. once you are done select exit and hit  ctrl+c to get out of the application.
